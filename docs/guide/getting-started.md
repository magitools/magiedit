There are two ways to use [magiedit](https://magiedit.magitools.app):

- hosted (on [magiedit](https://magiedit.magitools.app))
- self hosted

This documentation will focus on the latter.

And for self-hosting, there are a few options:

- Directly cloning the repository - see [Installing on a VPS](/guide/vps)
- Using the official [Docker Image](https://soon.tm) (coming soon) - see [Installing with Docker](/guide/docker)
- Using this repository with some cloud providers (coming soon)
